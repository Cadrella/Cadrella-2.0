VALUES('Sunflowers', '1001', '', '5', 'Van Gogh', 'Art','A sturdy wooden wall frame, minimalist in design, stretches across the living room wall—crafted from dark walnut with subtle grain textures that echo nature’s calm. Its corners are smoothly rounded, evoking a modern yet timeless feel. The frame surrounds a large canvas, centered perfectly at eye level, and softly illuminated by a pair of warm-toned LED sconces above. The contrast between the natural wood and the swirling blues of the canvas makes the art feel alive. Beneath the painting, a slim brass nameplate simply reads: Vincent van Gogh – 1889. The wall itself is painted a soft, matte stone gray, enhancing the dramatic blues and yellows within the artwork, making the entire frame seem like a portal into the dreamscape beyond.')
